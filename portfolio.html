                        <div id='type8' class='type'><p>This collection of material was part of a branding project with a focus on illustration to create an identity and elements for a hypothetical coffee shop in the Corktown section of Detroit, Michigan. I took a historical approach with the overall aesthetic and theme of the brand, taking inspiration from Detroit's rich industry during the 19th century, which mainly consisted of breweries, railroads, and foundries. These three categories would become the three different roasts that the coffee shop would produce as well as the subjects in which all of the illustrations would stem from. The inspiration for the main logo comes from a 19th century coffee bean grinder, and while subtle, many of the illustrations in the brand have some coffee tidbits inserted in them to tie the brand theme together with its purpose.</p>

This project in particular was a labor of love, having been to Mackinac Island many times over the years. The main imagery that appears throughout the campaign material is one of many of my personal photographs, which was then edited into four-tone greyscale, and finally colored in via vectors in Illustrator with the brand colors I established for the festival. The pieces include a poster, a brochure, a billboard, a website preview, a golden ticket, as well as a fudge box.</p>
